# Profile Screen Update - Spotify-Style Design

## 🎯 **Problem Fixed**
The previous profile screen contained library-style content (saved music, playlists, liked songs) which should actually be on the "Your Library" page. The profile screen has been redesigned to match the actual Spotify profile page layout.

## 🎨 **New Profile Screen Design**

### **Header Section**
- **Large Profile Picture** - Prominent circular avatar (160px diameter)
- **User Name** - Large, bold display name
- **Follower/Following Count** - "42 followers • 125 following" format
- **Action Buttons** - "Edit profile" button and options menu
- **Navigation** - Back button and more options in app bar

### **Content Sections**

#### 1. **Public Playlists**
- Shows user's public playlists in horizontal scroll
- Displays playlist cover art, name, and song count
- "Show all" button if more than 5 playlists
- Only shows if user has public playlists

#### 2. **Recently Played**
- Horizontal scroll of recently played tracks
- Shows album art, track name, and artist
- Displays last 5 recently played items

#### 3. **Following (Artists)**
- Artists the user follows
- Large circular artist images
- Artist name with "Artist" label
- "Show all" option for more artists

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **SliverAppBar Structure**
```dart
SliverAppBar(
  expandedHeight: 300,
  pinned: true,
  flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(
    background: _ProfileHeaderSection(user: currentUser),
  ),
)
```

### **Component Organization**
- `_ProfileHeaderSection` - Main profile info and buttons
- `_UserPublicPlaylistsSection` - Public playlists carousel
- `_RecentlyPlayedSection` - Recently played tracks
- `_ArtistsSection` - Followed artists display

### **Data Integration**
- Uses `MockDataService.instance` for realistic data
- Filters user's public playlists
- Shows recently played tracks with proper metadata
- Displays followed artists with profile images

## 📱 **User Experience**

### **Visual Design**
- **Spotify Dark Theme** - Consistent with app theme
- **Large Visual Elements** - Prominent images and clear hierarchy
- **Horizontal Scrolling** - Easy browsing of content
- **Clean Typography** - Clear text hierarchy and spacing

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Edit Profile Button** - Styled like Spotify's design
- **Show All Buttons** - Navigate to full content views
- **Responsive Images** - Proper error handling for missing images
- **Touch Targets** - Properly sized for mobile interaction

## 🔄 **Content Separation**

### **Profile Page (Current)**
✅ User information and public activity
✅ Public playlists and followed artists
✅ Recently played content
✅ Social features (followers/following)

### **Library Page (Existing)**
✅ All saved content (liked songs, saved albums)
✅ All playlists (public and private)
✅ Downloaded music
✅ Content management and organization

## 🎵 **Real Spotify Comparison**

The new design closely matches Spotify's actual profile page:
- **Large header with profile image** ✅
- **Follower/following counts** ✅
- **Public playlists section** ✅ 
- **Recently played section** ✅
- **Following artists section** ✅
- **Clean, minimal design** ✅

This creates an authentic Spotify experience that users will immediately recognize and understand!
